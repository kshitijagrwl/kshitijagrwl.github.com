      <description>We are witnessing a revival of interest in the space of metric learning or representation learning, due to the popularity of embedding models in the NLP space. I thought of penning down some thoughts on the evolution of metric learning over the years, particularly from the point of view of computer vision.
Learning a powerful and generalizable representation has been of particular interest to researchers, as it has applications across a multitude of tasks like classification, person re-identification, face recognition, information retreival and recommender systems.</description>
