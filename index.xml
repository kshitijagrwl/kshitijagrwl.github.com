      <description>What is Image Matting Natural image matting is a fundamental computer vision task, which aims to predict an alpha matte of the foreground object from a given image. An image can be represented by a linear combination of foreground and background, with a blending of a parameter alpha. Mathematically, image matting is formulated as:
Ii = αiFi + (1 − αi)Bi ,
where Ii, αi, Fi and Bi are observed colour value, alpha value, foreground value and background value of pixel i, respectively.</description>

      <description>We are witnessing a revival of interest in the space of metric learning or representation learning, due to the popularity of embedding models in the NLP space. I thought of penning down some thoughts on the evolution of metric learning over the years, particularly from the point of view of computer vision.
Learning a powerful and generalizable representation has been of particular interest to researchers, as it has applications across a multitude of tasks like classification, person re-identification, face recognition, information retreival and recommender systems.</description>

      <description>Having seen multiple 0-to-1 journies, I enjoy the challenge of building and scaling new technological systems. I have worked across marketplaces, chipmakers, military-tech, gaming/adtech, generative apps, hrms systems and many more. Here is how I like to select projects
High-Value Projects: I seek projects that leverage my expertise and unlock significant impact for startups and founders. Exploring new industries: I intend to pursue opportunities that explore different avenues and industries while leveraging my knowledge across systems.</description>

      <description>I have 10 years of experience building large scale computer vision and nlp systems in innovation teams across small to large enterprises.
I have deployed large scale LLM/CV solutions, for document processing, image generation and face recognition (at Swiggy), autonomous driving (at Intel) and night vision systems (deployed on Arjun Tank4). I have published research at AI conferences - NeurIPs, AAAI and ICCV.
Research Interests Embeddings for multi-task representation Search systems Named entity recognition Natural information extraction Face Recognition / Verification Multimodal systems Few shot learning Semantic Segmentation Object detection Here are a list of my publications</description>
